<p>Give a high-level overview of what you implemented in this homework Think about what you've built as a whole. Share your thoughts on what interesting things you've learned from completing the homework.</p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Rasterizing single-color triangles</h3>

<p>Here is an example 2x2 gridlike structure using an HTML table. Each <b>tr</b> is a row and each <b>td</b> is a column in that row. You might find this useful for framing and showing your result images in an organized fashion.</p>

<div align="middle">
  <table style="width=100%">
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img src="./images/Screen Shot 2024-02-10 at 1.20.01 PM.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
        <figcaption align="middle">Caption goes here.</figcaption>
		<p> We began with drawing rasterize_lines 3 times with the given 3 coordinates, so that it draw triangles. After that we referenced the lecture slides on using the for loops to fill out the triangles. We first need to find the minX, maxX, minY and maxY coordinates, we did that using if statements although having built-in min and max functions could have been more efficient. We used those variables and set them as i and j. We had to make sure to floor the maxX and maxY values, and that they are inclusive in the for loop condition. Then we calculate the weights for each coordinate by creating the point_in_triangle helper function, and passing in each coordinate +0.5. Then we rasterize the point if it satisfies the condition we set up. The problem we encountered was getting the right point_in_triangle function because we were testing out different methods including baycentric equations and others when it was so much more simpler. Another problem was thinking about the edge cases such as figuring out why we need to floor some values. The counterclockwise was the tricky part but we figured that it goes counter-clockwise when all the weights are more than or equal to 0. Therefore, we just modified the if statement. </p>
